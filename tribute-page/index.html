        <h2>A brief timeline of Ada Lovelace's life</h2>
        Here are some key moments that shaped Ada Lovelace's remarkable journey:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1815</strong> – Ada Lovelace is born, the daughter of poet Lord Byron.</li>
            <li><strong>1833</strong> – Meets Charles Babbage and begins collaborating with him.</li>
            <li><strong>1842–1843</strong> – Translates an article on Babbage's Analytical Engine, adding her own notes, including what is recognized as the first computer program.</li>
            <li><strong>1852</strong> – Ada Lovelace dies at the age of 36.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Achievements that changed computing</h2>
          These milestones highlight Ada Lovelace’s enduring contributions to the world of technology:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>First Computer Program</strong>: Ada Lovelace wrote the first published computer program, an algorithm intended for Babbage’s Analytical Engine. It is considered the earliest known example of a machine-executable algorithm.</li>
              <li><strong>Vision of Modern Computers</strong>: She foresaw that computers could go beyond mere calculations and could be used for more creative tasks, such as composing music and producing art.</li>
              <li><strong>Scientific Influence</strong>: Her insights into symbolic processing and her understanding that computers could work with abstract symbols contributed to the foundation of modern computing.</li>
            </ul>
